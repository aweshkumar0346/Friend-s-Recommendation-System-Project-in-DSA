# Friend-s-Recommendation-System-Project-in-DSA
This project revolves around creating a recommendation system for social media platforms, specifically focusing on suggesting potential connections between users based on mutual friends and shared interests. Each user's profile is represented as a node within a graph structure, with connections (edges) between nodes indicating friendships. The strength of these connections, or the weight of the edges, is determined by factors such as the number of mutual friends, common interests, and user interactions like liking or disliking posts. Utilizing various data structures such as queues for friend requests, linked lists for storing user posts, and a priority queue for implementing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, the system aims to efficiently manage and analyze user data to provide accurate recommendations.

Within this simulated social network environment, users are provided with a range of functionalities to interact with the system. They can send and accept friend requests, save liked posts, and receive personalized recommendations based on shared interests or mutual connections. Additionally, a newsfeed-like feature aggregates user posts, posts from close friends, and pending friend requests, providing users with a comprehensive overview of their social interactions within the platform. By implementing these features, the project aims to mimic real-world social media experiences while demonstrating the underlying mechanisms behind recommendation systems.

Through the development of this project, valuable insights into the practical application of data structures and algorithms have been gained. By simulating social interactions and analyzing user data, the project underscores the importance of efficient data management and algorithmic design in solving complex problems. Furthermore, the project offers a deeper understanding of recommendation systems and their role in enhancing user experiences on social media platforms. Overall, this endeavor serves as an educational exploration into the intersection of computer science and social networking.
